# Memory Game Project

# How the the game works:
Click on the card and try to find the matched card, you can’t flip more than tow cards, when you win the game you'll see your results, if you want to restart the game click on the reset button in top-right corner of the screen.

# How the star rating works:
When you opening 2 cards it’s count as one move, if you won the game with 8 moves you will get 3 stars, more than 8 moves and less than or equal 12 moves you will get 2 stars, more than 12 move you will just get 1 star.
